# Exercise

A UI dev exercise.

The purpose of the exercise is to demonstrate usage of basic AngularJS skills as well as basic design principles and ability to creatively and scalably use HTML, CSS and other browser technologies.

Included in this repository is a simple Angular.js app with a single state that displays a (potentially outdated) list of Formula 1 drivers and teams.

## The Problem

Create a racing standings board and display information about each of the teams the pilots belong to. In addition to that, create a real time visualization of the race in visual aesthetic of your choice. 

Make sure the design is responsive and doesn't make a low powered mobile device such as first gen Motorola Moto X come to a grinding halt. :)

Feel free to add views, change whatever you want in the app, add new dependencies etc etc. (don't run too wild with those though, it's best to achieve a lot with little)

## Tips to get started

Install Node.js in your system

    https://nodejs.org/en/download/

Install gulp and bower packages globally for Node.js (used for dependency management and app build)

	npm install -g gulp bower

Go to the UI-Exercise folder

Install npm dependencies

    npm install

Install bower dependencies

    bower install

Run gulp task

    gulp

All yours, have fun!


PS: I have no idea about Formula1 or racing in general, this is just a running theme for this kind of exercises here. :)
